# Pricing
This project is to develop a pricing scheme for a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores. More specifically, we must recommend a pricing strategy that will maximize store revenues while still maintaining profits. 
Additionally, there are a set of constraints that we must abide by. These constraints include 100 products that are to be priced, belonging to 2 product categories, to be offered at 10 stores. Thus, we must find the combination of products, categories, and stores that optimize total revenue based on the new prices we set.
